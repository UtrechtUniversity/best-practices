# Best practices

Welcome at the best practices for git, research software development, and research data management. This repository was created for and by researchers and support staff of Utrecht University. The community is strongly encouraged to share best practices in this repository. 

## Topics

### Using Git and Github

Git is free and open-source software for version management. It was created in the 2005 and is nowadays the facto-standard version control software for software development. GitHub is an online service based on Git that makes it easy to work together and share your work openly. It can also be used as a backup of your local work. Learning Git and GitHub can be steep in the beginning, but will be worth all the effort. 

**Quick start**

1. [Create GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
2. [Download and install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. [Authenticate GitHub for Utrecht University](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/getting-started) [OPTIONAL]
4. [Create your first repository with Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview)

### FAIR Software

The [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) are a framework that is widely used in research data management. The acronym stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Recently, the FAIR principles are applied to [research software](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026) by Anna-Lena Lamprecht et al (2020).

**Tools**

- [Python package to analyze a GitHub or GitLab repository's compliance with the fair-software.eu recommendations](https://github.com/fair-software/howfairis)

### Visibility

To facilitate reuse of your wonderful work, people should be able to find you and your work. GitHub offers a lot of options to make your research software more visible. 

**Quick start**

- Add a [bio and profile README to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile) 
- Add GitHub profile to [your staff page](https://www.uu.nl/staff/)
- Add [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to your repository to increase findability https://github.com/topics. There is also topic for [`#utrecht-university`](https://github.com/topics/utrecht-university).
